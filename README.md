# GameBoy Emulator

## TODO
- [x] Some games show weird sprites where only one single color is being shown. Not happening in others
- [x] At some instances (usually near the screen's end) sprite is split apart. For example a sprite `[]` looks like `] [` instead
- [ ] Sprites missing in some games; Those which show do it correctly
